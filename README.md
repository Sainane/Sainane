### 🏆 Featured Project: LLM-Powered Book Recommendation System (HES Bachelor's Thesis)

I earned a top grade of **6/6** for my thesis, which involved architecting and deploying a containerized recommendation system from the ground up. The system provides relevant and justifiable book suggestions based on a deep semantic analysis of over 5,000 full texts
  * **Backend:** Developed a robust backend using Python and FastAPI.
  * **Database:** Implemented a vector database with PostgreSQL and the `pgvector` extension for high-performance semantic search.
  * **Data Pipeline:** Built a data processing pipeline that leverages the Gemini API to generate summaries and themes for each book.
  * **Frontend:** Created a user-friendly interface with Vue.js.
  * **DevOps:** The entire full-stack application is containerized with Docker

### 🤖 Another Noteworthy Project: Automated Chessboard
This project, which won the **Best Project Award** and earned a grade of **6/6**, is a physical chessboard where pieces move autonomously. It allows a user to play against an AI via a touchscreen and is powered by a custom-designed 2-axis CNC mechanism and control PCB that I designed and manufactured.
