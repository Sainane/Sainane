### **üèÜ Featured Project: LLM-Powered Book Recommendation System (HES Bachelor's Thesis)**

I earned a top grade of **6/6** for my thesis, which involved architecting and deploying a containerized recommendation system from the ground up. The system provides relevant and justifiable book suggestions based on a deep semantic analysis of over 5,000 full texts.

* **Backend:** Developed a robust backend using Python and FastAPI.  
* **Database:** Implemented a vector database with PostgreSQL and the pgvector extension for high-performance semantic search.  
* **Data Pipeline:** Built a data processing pipeline that leverages the Gemini API to generate summaries and themes for each book.  
* **Frontend:** Created a user-friendly interface with Vue.js.  
* **DevOps:** The entire full-stack application is containerized with Docker.

### **üå± PlantKeeper: IoT Plant Management System (Group Project)**

As part of a team at HEIG-VD, I contributed to PlantKeeper, an innovative solution to help users effortlessly manage the well-being of their home plants. The system combines hardware and software to monitor environmental conditions and ensure plants receive optimal care.

* **Architecture:** The project features a distributed architecture, with code organized across five repositories for the frontend, backend, IoT sensors, and servers.  
* **My Role:** Contributed as part of the development team to build this comprehensive system.

### **üìä Ant Colony Simulator Using Mesa**

This project is a simulation of an ant colony using the Mesa library, allowing users to visualize the behavior of ants in a simulated environment.

* **Features:** Users can modify parameters suchs as the number of ants, food sources, and spread of food sources on a home screen. The simulation then visualizes ants moving, following pheromones, collecting food, and returning to their nest. It also displays the total food collected and the simulation steps.  
* **Technologies:** Python, Mesa Library.

### **ü§ñ Another Noteworthy Project: Automated Chessboard**

This project, which won the **Best Project Award** and earned a grade of **6/6**, is a physical chessboard where pieces move autonomously. It allows a user to play against an AI via a touchscreen and is powered by a custom-designed 2-axis CNC mechanism and control PCB that I designed and manufactured.
